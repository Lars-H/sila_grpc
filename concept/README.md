# Proto Files

This directory is used to hold the .proto-Files. These Proto files are still work in progress and mainly used to explore the possibilities and to figure out adequate namspacing and other issues.

## sila_standard

This directory should hold the proto files for the mandatory feature "is_sila". Furthermore, for now it holds a concept for a standard library to hold messages that are used frequently. This should reduce redundancy.
